Find the Sum of the First N Natural Numbers in Python
Given an integer input of N, the objective is to find the sum of all the natural numbers until the given input integer. To do so we can use different approaches to write the Python code and some such methods are mentioned below,

Method 1 : Using for Loop
Method 2 : Using Formula for the Sum of Nth Term
Method 3 : Using Recursion
We’ll discuss and learn more about each above mentioned method in detail in the sections below.


Sum of N natural numbers

Sum of numbers in a given range

Greatest of two numbers

Greatest of the Three numbers

Leap year or not

**Method 1 : Using for Loop
In this method we’ll add all the natural numbers until the given integer input using for loop in Python.


num = 5
sum = 0
for i in range(num+1):
  sum+=i
print(sum)
Output
15
Working
For a user input num.

 Initialize a variable sum = 0.
Using a for loop in iteration ‘i’ iterate between [1, num].
Each time add ‘i’ to current sum as sum = sum + i.
Print sum.
Explanation
Given an integer input N, the objective is to calculate the sum of all the natural numbers until the integer N. To do so we iterate through all the numbers that lay within N and keep incrementing the sum value.

The algorithm for the above code is as follows,

 Import the required module using the import keyword.
Initialize the required variables.
Run a for loop with range as N+1.
Keep adding the iter values to the Sum variable.
Print Sum variable using print() function.
The output for the above mentioned code is the sum of all the natural numbers until the given value.

**Method 2 : Using Formula for the Sum of Nth Term
In this Method we use the formula for finding the sum of N term.

Formula to Find the Sum of N terms
Sum = ( Num * ( Num + 1 ) ) / 2

Python Code
num = 5
print(int(num*(num+1)/2))
Output
15
Working
For a user input n.

Initialize a variable sum = 0.
Use formula sum = n(n+1)/2.
Print sum
Explanation
Given an integer input N, the objective is to calculate the sum of all the natural numbers until the integer N. To do so we iterate through all the numbers that lay within N and keep incrementing the sum value.

The algorithm for the above code is as follows,

 Import the required modules using the import keyword.
Initialize the required variables.
Run a for loop with range as N+1.
Keep adding the iter values to the Sum variable.
Print Sum variable using print() function.
This algorithm uses the formula n(n+1)/2 that can be used to find sum of first N natural numbers. This also reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1). The output for the above mentioned code is the sum of all the natural numbers until the given value.


**Method 3 : Using Recursion
This method uses Recursion to recursively add the natural numbers up to the given integer input using recursion in c++.

Python Code
def getSum(num):
  if num == 1:
    return 1
  return num + getSum(num-1)

num = 5
print(getSum(num))
Output
15
Working
For a user input n.

Initialize a variable sum = 0.
Call function getSum (num).
In each recursive call add the current value of n and call for lower recursion call using return num + getSum(num-1);
Print sum value
Explanation
Given an integer input N, the objective is to calculate the sum of all the natural numbers until the integer N. To do so we recursively call a function  iterate through all the numbers that lay within N and keep incrementing the sum value.

The algorithm for the above code is as follows,

 Import the required modules using the import keyword.
Define a Recursive function getSum() which takes the number input as an argument.
Recursively call the function and keep on adding the return statements.
Initialize the required variables.
Call the Recursive function and print out the returned value using cout keyword.
The output for the above mentioned code is the sum of all the natural numbers until the given value.
